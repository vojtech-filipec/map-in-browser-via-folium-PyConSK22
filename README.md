# Set up an interactive map in browser in a few steps

## Customize a map with your points and share with ease

This notebook was prepared for PyConSk 2022 in Bratislava. It shows how to use library `folium` to project Points Of Interest onto a background map in a way that is easy to share. 

The notebook was rendered as HTML document with slides right from the Jupyter Notebook environment: simply go `File >> Download As >> Reveal.js slides (.slides.html)`

To reduce the file size, I deleted the outputs from the ipynb document. The HTML document is, on the contrary, is exactly as I was presenting it. However, as its size is almost 15 MB GitHub fails to display it as HTML but rather resorts to a plain text. 

To see the HTML document as a slide-deck, proceed as follows:
- click on the file, 
- then either select "See raw" or "Download"; in both cases you will see a page with plain text in your browser,
- save this page as a document to your local (in browser, go File >> Save As), 
- open the document with your browser.
