# Set up an interactive map in browser in a few steps

## Customize a map with your points and share with ease

### Content
This notebook was prepared for PyConSk 2022 in Bratislava. It shows how to use library `folium` to project Points Of Interest onto a background map in a way that is easy to share. 

### Abstract
Maps are popular means to visualise geospatial data. Companies often possess datapoints with latitute and longitude; nonetheless, data analysts typically lack skills to visualise this data as a map. This talk explains how to set up a map with your custom data in a web browser. We are going to talk about library `folium` that takes care of rendering the map, and how to feed your custom data into it.

### How to save a notebook as slides
The notebook was rendered as HTML document with slides right from the Jupyter Notebook environment: simply go `File >> Download As >> Reveal.js slides (.slides.html)`

### How to see the slides at GitHub
To reduce the file size, I deleted the outputs from the ipynb document. The HTML document is, on the contrary, is exactly as I was presenting it. However, as its size is almost 15 MB GitHub fails to display it as HTML but rather resorts to a plain text. 

To see the HTML document as a slide-deck, proceed as follows:
- click on the file, 
- then either select "See raw" or "Download"; in both cases you will see a page with plain text in your browser,
- save this page as a document to your local (in browser, go File >> Save As), 
- open the document with your browser.
